# Single source of truth for every bc2cpp-generated gem's own target
# owners and OUT_SYMBOL -- both mruby-lcf-compiled/mrbgem.rake and
# mruby-rpg2k-compiled/mrbgem.rake `require` this instead of hardcoding
# each other's owner list (real drift risk otherwise) or `target_owners`
# duplicated between files.
#
# Also what makes cross-gem devirtualization (docs/adr/0139's own
# follow-up) possible at all: each mrbgem.rake computes its own
# OTHER_OWNERS/OTHER_DECLS_HEADER from every *other* entry here, so a
# devirtualized call from one compiled gem into another's target class can
# reference a real, externally-linked _impl declared via that other gem's
# own *_decls.h (see bc2cpp.rb's own emit_decls_header comment) -- without
# either gem's own bc2cpp codegen step needing to read the other's
# generated output (that would be a circular Rake dependency; only the
# final C++ compile of register.cxx needs both gems' generated files to
# already exist, which mrbgem.rake wires as a `file` dependency, not this).
