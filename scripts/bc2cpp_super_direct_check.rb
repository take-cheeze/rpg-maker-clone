# SUPER_NO_CALLER_BLOCK (ADR 0332): `super` becomes a direct `_impl` call with no
# block because the build PROVES no caller ever passes one, rather than that
# being a hand-vetted allowlist entry (SUPER_TARGETS, ADR 0146).
#
# A compiled `_impl` has no block parameter, so OP_SUPER's forwarded block would
# be dropped. The proof must therefore refuse as readily as it admits: a
# block-carrying send of the same name to the class, to a subclass, or with an
# unproven receiver all keep the `#error`. `Base#go` reads its block, so a
# dropped one is an observable wrong answer (nil) rather than a silent no-op.
