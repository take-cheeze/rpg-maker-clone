# Regression check for scripts/bc2cpp_prune_never_called_registrations.rb: if
# a later round hand-adds a register.cxx registration for a method that is
# (still, or newly) never-called and owned by a class
# tools/bc2cpp/never_called_registrations.rb's own safety rule clears, this
# fails loudly with the exact name(s) rather than letting the wasted flash
# back in silently. A clean run means every such candidate has already been
# pruned -- see that file's own header comment for the full owner-safety
# argument (Game::/RPG2k::/RPG2k3::/LCF:: only, never wired-embedding or
# `.singleton`, never mruby-rgss-compiled).
#
# Needs a host mrbc (MRBC), like the other bc2cpp checks; takes about as long
# as bc2cpp_wired_embedding_check.rb per gem (one real bc2cpp.rb run each for
# mruby-rpg2k-compiled and mruby-lcf-compiled).
#
# Usage: MRBC=/path/to/mrbc ruby scripts/bc2cpp_never_called_registrations_check.rb
