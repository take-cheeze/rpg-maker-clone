# A real near-miss, not a hypothetical: `LCF::Database#maker` shows up in
# tools/bc2cpp/bc2cpp.rb's own "never called" diagnostic (zero evidence in
# `closed_world_mrblib_srcs`/`NATIVE_SRCS` -- see tools/bc2cpp/
# never_called_registrations.rb), which is exactly the same evidence
# `Game::Character#front_tile` has. `front_tile` really is dead and its
# `def` was deleted outright (docs/adr/0194). `#maker` is NOT dead: it is
# called from `mruby-lcf/test/lcf_test.rb`, `scripts/lcf_testbed_check.rb`
# and `scripts/rpg2k3_battle_command_check.rb` -- real callers bc2cpp.rb's
# own reachability scan has no visibility into at all, since it only ever
# reads `closed_world_mrblib_srcs` (the engine's own mrblib) and
# `NATIVE_SRCS`, by design (that scope is right for what it decides --
# whether an AOT override is worth registering -- because the interpreted
# `def` staying in place means a missed call site there is still correct,
# just uncompiled; deleting the `def` outright removes the only
# implementation, so a missed call site there is a real `NoMethodError`).
#
# This script is the mandatory second check before deleting a method's
# `def` permanently (never before just pruning its bc2cpp registration --
# that tier's own safety net is the interpreted `def` staying put, which
# is exactly what this check does not have once a `def` is really gone):
# a plain, repo-wide, case-sensitive text search for `name` across
# everything except vendored submodules (`3rd/`) and build output/scratch
# directories, so a call from a test file, a `scripts/*.rb` check harness,
# a doc example, or anywhere else outside the engine's own mrblib is
# caught before the deletion happens, not after.
#
# This is deliberately a blunt, whole-repo grep, not another whole-program
# bytecode/AST analysis: the point is to see everything bc2cpp.rb's own
# scan cannot, and a text search can look at file kinds (test/, scripts/,
# docs/) that scan was never built to parse at all. A false positive
# (the name appears as a comment, or as a substring of an unrelated
# identifier) only ever costs a manual look, never a wrong deletion --
# the same "a miss stays safe, a false match costs nothing but a second
# look" posture every other diagnostic in this codebase already uses.
#
# Usage: ruby scripts/bc2cpp_def_deletion_safety_check.rb <method_name> [<method_name> ...]
# Exits non-zero (and prints every match) if any method name has a real
# hit outside its own known definition site; 0 and silent otherwise.
