# Removes the hand-written register.cxx line for every compiled entry named in
# tools/bc2cpp/static_dispatch_unregistered.rb (docs/adr/0203). The generated
# registration for BC2CPP_WIRED_EMBEDDINGS owners already skips those names
# itself (bc2cpp.rb's emit_owner_registrations); this is the same for the
# hand-maintained lines of every other owner. Needs no mrbc: a line is removed
# only when BOTH its name literal is the listed method's name AND its entry
# symbol is the one bc2cpp.rb's own cpp_name spells for that owner
# (`"#{owner}_#{name}"` with every non-[A-Za-z0-9_] byte turned into `_`), so
# a mismatch can only ever leave a line in place, never take the wrong one.
#
# Usage: ruby scripts/bc2cpp_prune_static_dispatch_registrations.rb
