# The mruby facts MODULE_SUPER_SUPPORT (ADR 0329) rests on, measured rather than
# assumed:
#
#   1. `super` from a class resolves INTO an included module, not the
#      superclass. This is why super_reaches_superclass? declines on any plain
#      `include`, and why resolving through the module is correct.
#   2. included modules are searched NEWEST-FIRST, so with two includes the last
#      one wins -- the order module_super_target walks.
#   3. a prepended module sits ABOVE the class, so a prepended `super` target
#      is not the one the class's own super reaches.
#   4. OP_SUPER forwards the caller's block: a block given to the re-defining
#      method reaches the module body that reads it. `(1..5).max { -b }` being
#      1 rather than 5 is the same fact seen from Range.
#
# If a future mruby searched differently, this fails here rather than silently
# mis-resolving a super in the compiler.
