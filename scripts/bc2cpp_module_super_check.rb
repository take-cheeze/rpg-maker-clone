# MODULE_SUPER_SUPPORT: `super` reaching an included module, with the current
# frame's block forwarded (ADR 0329).
#
# The real case is mruby's own Range: Range includes Enumerable and
# mruby-range-ext redefines #max/#min with `super(&block)`, which lands in
# Enumerable#max/#min -- bodies that DO read the block and are CORE_BLOCK_GUARDed
# because they yield (ADR 0269). Two things therefore have to hold, and this
# check is mostly about the second:
#
#   1. resolution -- `super` must be looked up through the included module, over
#      mruby's [class, modules newest-first, superclass] order, across BOTH the
#      engine registry and the compiled-core index (core owners are absent from
#      the former). mruby-range-ext's `super(&block)` is a plain `SUPER n=0`; a
#      bare `super` in a method with parameters is a zsuper (ARGARY + `SUPER
#      n=*`), a different shape that keeps its `#error`.
#   2. block forwarding -- a super that dropped the block would silently return
#      the wrong answer: `pick { |a,b| -b }` is 1, not 3. The emitted call must
#      carry this frame's block, and a guard-protected body may only be reached
#      when the build proved it yield-free.
#
# The Fiber cases live in bc2cpp_module_super_fiber_check.rb: putting a
# `Fiber.new` call to `pick` in this same world would make every pick
# "reachable from a Fiber.new block", which is its own (correct) refusal and
# would mask what is being measured here.
