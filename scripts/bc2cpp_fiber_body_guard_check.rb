# FIBER_BODY_GUARD (ADR 0333): a Fiber-reachable method whose OWN body cannot
# suspend compiles behind the run-time hand-off CORE_BLOCK_GUARD already uses for
# core methods (ADR 0269). This clears LCF::Array2D#each, Game::Actors#each and
# Game::Party#each, which only FORWARD the caller's block.
#
# What the check pins is the SAFETY property, not the fixture's reachability:
# the guard must (a) not admit a body that suspends the Fiber itself, and (b) let
# a block that really does yield from inside a Fiber resume correctly through the
# compiled entry -- which is the case that would raise FiberError, or crash, if a
# compiled frame were left between the fiber entry and the yield.
#
# The whole-program pass measures the rest: scripts/bc2cpp_fiber_body_guard_
# range_check is deliberately absent, because a fixture cannot reproduce the
# engine's Fiber root (mruby-wolf's `@fiber = Fiber.new { execute }` plus the
# RGSS gem set). That is measured by scripts/bc2cpp_coverage_report.rb instead.
