# Check StableClassConstants.analyze_native (tools/bc2cpp/const_site_cache.rb):
# a bare name a native mrbgem defines exactly once as a class/module (Symbol,
# Array, and every other core/native class the ordinary Ruby-statement-based
# StableClassConstants.analyze can never see) is admitted into the SAME
# const-site cache set, provided it is never reassigned/removed/autoloaded --
# a Ruby-level REOPENING of that same class must still be admitted (reopening
# never rebinds the constant), while a genuinely ambiguous native definition,
# a reassignment, or a foreign-Ruby-defined same-named class must not be.
