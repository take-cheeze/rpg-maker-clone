# Regression check for STATIC_DISPATCH_UNREGISTRATION (docs/adr/0203).
#
# Every name in tools/bc2cpp/static_dispatch_unregistered.rb has no
# mrb_define_method registration: the proof is that no runtime method-table
# lookup can ever reach it (tools/bc2cpp/static_dispatch_registrations.rb's
# own header lists everything that counts as a lookup). That proof is only as
# good as the tree it ran on, so this re-runs it on every CI run and fails if:
#
#   - a listed name is no longer a compiled entry point of its owner (the
#     method was renamed/removed, or stopped compiling -- its bytecode `def`
#     would then be the only implementation, still unregistered but now also
#     possibly stripped), or
#   - a listed name has gained ANY dynamic reference: a send from bytecode
#     that can run, an interned name in generated C++, a symbol/string
#     literal, `super`, or a mention in core mrblib/native/test/script
#     sources. That would be a live NoMethodError the first time it ran, so
#     it is a hard failure, not a warning -- drop the name from the list
#     (re-run the tool with --write) and let it be registered again, or
#     remove the new dynamic reference.
#   - a hand-written register.cxx line still registers a listed name (a
#     wasted registration, not a correctness problem -- fixed by
#     scripts/bc2cpp_prune_static_dispatch_registrations.rb).
#
# Names that are eligible but not yet listed are reported, not failed: the
# list only ever needs to be a sound subset.
#
# Needs a host mrbc (MRBC), like the other bc2cpp checks; runs bc2cpp.rb once
# per compiled gem plus one closed-world parse.
#
# Usage: MRBC=/path/to/mrbc ruby scripts/bc2cpp_static_dispatch_check.rb
