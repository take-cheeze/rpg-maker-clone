# frozen_string_literal: true

# RBS_SEED_CONTRADICTION (tools/bc2cpp/annotation_contradictions.rb): a
# `# bc2cpp:` annotation that names a DIFFERENT comparable type than the one the
# analysis proved is a build error.
#
# The rule is deliberately narrow, and each exclusion below is a real case from
# this repository rather than a hypothetical:
#
#   * :nil_literal does NOT contradict. RGSS::Scene::Battle#battle_level_up_lines
#     annotates `before_level` as fixnum, and its one call site is guarded
#     (`... if before_level`), so ArgTypes proves :nil_literal. Both statements
#     are true -- the annotation is a claim about the non-nil case -- so refusing
#     it would refuse a correct annotation of the shape annotations most often
#     take. Spinel reaches the same conclusion: a signature that only turns out
#     wrong at run time "is reinterpreted rather than widened".
#   * a class name does NOT contradict. ClassAnnotations is a different lattice
#     (no shared representation with IvarLayout's :fixnum/:symbol), so comparing
#     the two would invent a disagreement rather than find one.
#   * UNKNOWN / an unrepresented type does NOT contradict. That is an absent
#     fact, not a conflicting one.
#
# So a contradiction is :fixnum against :symbol, or :symbol against :fixnum, and
# nothing else.
