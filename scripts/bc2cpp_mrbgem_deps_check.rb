# Check STALE_REQUIRE_RELATIVE_DEPS (see each *-compiled/mrbgem.rake's own
# comment): the Rake `file generated => [...]` rule for each compiled gem's
# generated C++ must depend on EVERY file under tools/bc2cpp/*.rb (globbed,
# not the single bc2cpp.rb path) -- bc2cpp.rb require_relative's several
# sibling files (native_expression_devirt.rb, symbol_cache.rb,
# const_site_cache.rb, ...) that change its generated output just as much as
# bc2cpp.rb itself. Editing only one of those never touched bc2cpp.rb's own
# mtime, so Rake considered an already-built `generated` file up to date and
# silently kept stale C++ on the next incremental build.
#
# A text check, not a Rake-execution one: mrbgem.rake runs inside mruby's own
# Gem::Specification.new block (MRuby::Gem::Specification#initialize's own
# instance_eval), which this script has no way to drive standalone the way
# the other bc2cpp_*_check.rb scripts drive bc2cpp.rb directly.
