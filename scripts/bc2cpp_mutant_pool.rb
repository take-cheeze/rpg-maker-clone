# subprocess and independent of the others, so they run concurrently instead of back to back
# (docs/ci.md, "Mutant pool"). Results are handed back in input order, so the log and the
# pass/fail lines read the same as a serial run.
#
# BC2CPP_JOBS bounds the concurrency (default: the core count, at most 4); 1 is the old serial run.
