# bc2cpp coverage report: regenerates tools/bc2cpp/bc2cpp.rb's whole-program
# wio closed-world diagnostic (every owner across all three compiled gems --
# mruby-rpg2k-compiled/mruby-lcf-compiled/mruby-rgss-compiled -- combined,
# with the actual wio gem set and outside-source proof inputs) and prints a small,
# stats-only summary: compiled-entry-point and
# #error counts, a method-level coverage percentage (attempted vs. actually
# compiled clean), and both the resolved AND the poisoned-to-unknown side of
# every ivar/return/argument fact the diagnostic proves -- an "unknown"
# count that used to be silently dropped (ClassLayout's own analyze() only
# ever returned the resolved half; this script's own bc2cpp.rb change adds
# a `.known`/`.unknowns` split mirroring the one ArrayElementLayout already
# had, so the poisoned ivars are reportable too).
#
# Deliberately NOT the generated C++ itself: a single gem's own generated
# output runs past 250K lines, and even an unrelated bc2cpp.rb/mrblib edit
# can reshuffle register numbers and line order across the whole file --
# tracking that in git would make every commit's diff unreviewable and put
# any two concurrent bc2cpp-touching PRs into a guaranteed merge conflict in
# a file neither of them meaningfully changed. This report is the cheaper
# alternative: aggregate counts only, so the report can be published in the
# CI job summary and copied into a PR description without adding a generated
# file that conflicts whenever two concurrent bc2cpp changes land together.
# Contains no timestamp or other run-specific content.
#
# Usage: MRBC=path/to/host/mrbc ruby scripts/bc2cpp_coverage_report.rb
# Requires a host mrbc already built (3rd/mruby/build/host, the same
# prerequisite every real mruby-*-compiled/mrbgem.rake Rake task already
# has). Writes to stdout. Set BC2CPP_COVERAGE_REPORT_PATH to write a file
# instead (used by callers that need to capture the report). Set
# BC2CPP_COVERAGE_KEEP_DIR to also keep the shipped pass's generated C++.
