# Removes the register.cxx registration line of every compiled entry point
# tools/bc2cpp/never_called_registrations.rb finds both never-called (zero
# evidence anywhere in this program's own bytecode or NATIVE_SRCS -- bc2cpp.
# rb's own "== never called ==" diagnostic) and safe to stop registering
# (see that file's own header comment for the full owner-safety argument:
# Game::/RPG2k::/RPG2k3::/LCF:: only, never a wired-embedding or `.singleton`
# owner, never mruby-rgss-compiled -- RGSS is the real public scripting API
# a per-game "stock script" can call, invisible to any static analysis here).
#
# Only mruby-rpg2k-compiled and mruby-lcf-compiled are scanned:
# mruby-rgss-compiled owns no owner this file's own safety rule ever clears
# (Array/StringIO/RGSS::* all fail the namespace check), so running it there
# would only ever cost a wasted bc2cpp.rb invocation for zero candidates.
#
# This is a source-mutating tool, not a CI check (see the sibling
# scripts/bc2cpp_never_called_registrations_check.rb for the check that
# verifies its own output stays applied) -- run it by hand, inspect the
# real diff it produces (a removed registration still needs a human/AI
# sanity read: does the removed method's own name/owner really look like
# something no game could plausibly call?), and commit deliberately, the
# same way the registration-completeness batches that grew these files
# were applied by hand rather than as an automatic build step.
