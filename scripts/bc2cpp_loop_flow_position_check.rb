# LOOP_FLOW_POSITION (docs/adr/0398): a send compiled from an inlined loop body takes the flow position the proof
# reads, instead of being judged with no position (closed_world_site got `idx` nil there).
#   - a receiver the block defines is judged at the block's own flow position;
#   - a receiver read from a method local (GETUPVAR at level 0) is refused (upvar_narrowed): the method's flow at the
#     loop's SENDB created proven dead fallbacks in mruby-rpg2k's Scene::Map, so that path is out of ADR 0398;
#   - a receiver holding the loop element is refused when the body reassigns the element register R1.
# The checks generate C++ for worlds through the closed-world generator and read the counts the generator
# prints under BC2CPP_LOOP_FLOW_REPORT=1 (accepted and refused positions, by path or reason):
#   1. positive: a receiver the block defines in an inlined `each` is judged (accepted local, proven tail);
#   2. negative: a method-local receiver is refused (upvar_narrowed) and its send stays by name;
#   3. negative: the element reassigned (refused element_reassigned);
#   4. negative: a receiver from an argument has no definition to read (its positions stay out of the proof).
# BC2CPP_LOOP_FLOW_POSITION=0 must leave every position out (no accepted, no refused count), the switch-off control.
# LFP_MUTANTS=1 (needs 1): the generator with one guard removed or a wrong position used at a time must fail a
# check: each mutant is a copy of tools/bc2cpp run through BC2CPP_TOOL.
