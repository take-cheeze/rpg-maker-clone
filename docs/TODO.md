# TODOs of this project

## RPG Maker 2k
- 🚧 Support all data schema of LCF — the core database, map tree and map-unit
  chunks needed for boot and gameplay are covered and validated against a real
  test-bed by `scripts/lcf_testbed_check.rb`. Remaining chunks that appear in
  real data but are not yet in `schema.rb` (surfaced by walking the test-bed):
  database items (usage/effect flags 25–28 and `animation_data` sub-chunks),
  `battle_anime2` frame/timing chunks, skill chunk 16, and a few map-unit
  chunks (42, 50, 60–62, 90 — save/encounter/parallax metadata). These are
  editor/battle/2003 details not on the walkable-game critical path
- ✅ Show window component for title scene
- ✅ Implement New Game functionality — builds the party, loads the start map
  and enters a walkable `Scene::Map` with events
- ✅ Implement Continue functionality — loads a saved game (portable `Marshal`
  save; the LCF `.lsd` format is a later refinement)

### Issue items needed to run Nepheshel

The runtime now boots past the title into gameplay: "New Game" builds the party,
loads the starting map and enters a walkable `Scene::Map` where the player can
move, talk to / trigger events (a working event-command interpreter with
messages, choices, switches/variables, party/gold/item changes, conditionals and
teleport), open a menu, save, and continue. The remaining work is mostly **the
parts that need the native build + real game assets to develop and verify**:
authentic chipset/charset rendering, audio, and the battle system. Everything
landed so far is exercised by unit tests (`mruby-lcf/test` and a host harness),
since the full SDL/mruby binary can't be built or run in this environment. The
LCF loaders are additionally smoke-tested against real downloaded test-bed
projects (`scripts/lcf_testbed_check.rb`, run in CI after the download step),
which parses a genuine game's `RPG_RT.ldb`/`.lmt`/`Map*.lmu` end to end and
catches format surprises the synthetic unit tests can't.

The work below is roughly ordered by the critical path to a walkable game
(1 → 2 → 3 → 4/5/6 → 7/8/9); battle and full menus can follow.

#### Boot into gameplay (unblocks everything)
- ✅ LMU map parsing — `MAP_UNIT` schema in `schema.rb` (`LCF::MapUnit`):
  dimensions, chipset id, lower/upper tile layers and events. Also fixed
  multi-part file parsing so the map tree exposes its `initial` start position,
  fixed nested `Array2D` fields (e.g. the actor table), and implemented the
  `int16_array`/`short_array` element types. Covered by `mruby-lcf/test`.
- ✅ New Game logic — `RPG2k#start_new_game` builds the party from the database
  (`Game::Party`/`Game::Actor`), reads the start position from the map tree,
  loads the starting map and pushes `Scene::Map` (replaces the TODO in
  `Scene::Title#update`)
- ✅ Map scene (`Scene::Map`) — hosts the running `Game::State`, renders the
  lower/upper tile layers, draws the party leader from their CharSet graphic,
  and supports grid movement with pixel interpolation, walk animation,
  edge/tile/event collision and an edge-clamped follow camera

#### Map & characters
- 🚧 Tilemap rendering — `Scene::Map` currently draws each tile as a solid
  colour block derived from its tile id (a navigable placeholder) and reads
  chipset passability for collision; real chipset blitting (lower/upper chip
  graphics, autotile assembly, tile animation) is the remaining work
- 🚧 Character sprites — the party leader renders from its CharSet graphic
  (`Game::CharSet`, 4-direction, 3 walk frames); NPC/event sprites are drawn as
  markers for now
- ✅ Movement & collision — grid movement with pixel interpolation, walk
  animation and edge/tile/event collision. Move-route *data* now decodes
  (`LCF.parse_move_commands` / `LCF::MoveCommand`, wired into the event-page and
  common-event `move_route` schema); driving events from those routes at runtime
  is still to come

#### Event system
- 🚧 Event pages — page conditions (switch/variable/item/actor) are implemented
  (`Game::EventPage`), and action-button + auto-start triggers run; touch,
  event-touch and parallel triggers plus move routes are still to come
- 🚧 Event command interpreter — `Game::Interpreter` runs a solid subset (Show
  Message + Choices, Control Switches/Variables, Change Gold/Items/Party,
  Conditional Branch/Else/End, Loop/Break/End, Label/Jump, Timer, Teleport,
  Wait, Play BGM/SE, End Event) with a per-frame step cap so a bad loop can't
  hang; the remaining ~90 commands (Move Event, pictures, screen effects,
  battles, actor stat changes, Call Event, ...) are TODO
- 🚧 Message window — renders text lines and a choice cursor and expands the
  common message control codes (`\v[n]` variable, `\n[n]` actor name, `\\`;
  colour/speed/wait codes are consumed). Face graphics, per-code colour changes
  and gradual text reveal are still TODO
- 🚧 Common events — auto-start and parallel common events run on the map
  (`Game::CommonEvent`), gated by their switch when `need_flag` is set; true
  concurrent parallel execution (running every frame alongside the player) is
  still simplified to a once-per-visit start
- 🚧 Screen effects — the game **timer** works (Timer Operation command +
  `Game::State` countdown); transitions/fade, tint, flash, shake, Show Picture
  and weather remain. `RGSS::Viewport` now exists (position/clip/scroll/z), but
  most of these still need more `RGSS::Sprite`/`Viewport` support in C++
  (opacity, tone, flash) before they can be driven from Ruby

#### Menus, save, battle
- 🚧 Menu scene — opens over the map (cancel button); shows party status and a
  command list. Save and End Game work; item / skill / equip / status are
  placeholders still to be built from the parsed `term`/item/skill/actor data
- 🚧 Save & Continue — implemented with a portable `Marshal` save of the game
  state (`Game::State#to_h` / `State.load`) written via the menu's Save command;
  "Continue" reloads it. Reading/writing the real `LCF::SaveData` (`.lsd`) format
  is still TODO
- Battle system — enemy groups, battle scene, actions/damage/states,
  animations, game-over scene (large; Nepheshel uses the default RPG2000
  battle). Needs real assets + the native build to develop against
- Item / Skill / Equip / Status menu screens — the menu framework and party
  data are in place; these screens still need building

#### Assets & infrastructure
- ✅ Audio playback — `RGSS::Audio` now plays real BGM/BGS/ME/SE through an
  SDL_mixer backend (`src/sdl_audio.cxx`), resolving names under
  `Music/`/`Sound/`/`Audio/*`. Remaining polish: pitch/tempo control (SDL_mixer
  exposes none) and guaranteeing a MIDI synth in the build (depends on the
  SDL_mixer build's MIDI support; WAV/OGG work everywhere)
- ✅ RTP resolution / `FullPackageFlag` (issue #40) — `RPG_RT.ini`'s
  `FullPackageFlag=1` clears `RTP_DIR`, and `Bitmap` lookup already falls back
  from the game directory to the RTP (with `.png`/`.xyz`/`.bmp` extensions)

## RPG Maker with RGSS
- Support game library features of RGSS which could be found in https://www.rpgmaker.fixato.org/Manual/RPGVXAce/rgss/

## RPG Maker with JavaScript

Support the JavaScript makers (RPG Maker **MV**, then **MZ**) by embedding a real
JavaScript engine (**quickjs-ng**) and running each game's own scripts
unmodified, rather than reimplementing the engine in mruby. MV is targeted first
because it can render through PIXI.js's Canvas2D path, which maps onto the
existing `mruby-rgss::Bitmap` blit primitives; MZ is WebGL-only and follows.
Full design and rationale: `docs/adr/0004-javascript-maker-mv-quickjs.md`.

- ✅ **M1 — Foundation.** New `mruby-mvjs` gem (thin Ruby orchestration layer:
  MV project detection, canonical script load order, boot/pump handshake with a
  clearly-marked seam for the JS host). MV directory sniffing wired into
  `src/main.cxx` (`js/rpg_core.js` + `data/System.json`). Host-runnable specs
  for the pure logic. No JS engine yet, so an MV game is detected but reports the
  runtime as pending instead of misbehaving.
- ✅ **M2 — Engine host.** quickjs-ng added as the `3rd/quickjs` git submodule and static-linked
  (`qjs` target) into the executable and the mruby test binary. `MV::JS.eval`
  opens a runtime/context, evaluates JavaScript and marshals scalar results
  (Integer/Float/String/true/false/nil), raising `RuntimeError` on a JS
  exception. `MV.js_available?` reports the engine's presence; `runtime_available?`
  stays false until the game host (M3/M4) lands. Covered by `mruby-mvjs/test`.
- 🚧 **M3 — Boot to title.** Host-global shims (`window`/`document`/`navigator`/
  `location`/`requestAnimationFrame`/`setTimeout`/`XMLHttpRequest`/`Image`/
  `localStorage`/`require('fs'|'path')`), the asset/JSON IO bridge, and the
  rAF/event-loop pump — enough to load the core scripts and reach `Scene_Title`.
  - ✅ Persistent JS host (one runtime/context reused across evals), the
    `window`/`self`/`global`/`globalThis` aliases, `console`, a native file
    reader and a synchronous `XMLHttpRequest` (the JSON/asset IO bridge).
  - ✅ Event loop: `setTimeout`/`setInterval`/`clearTimeout`,
    `requestAnimationFrame`/`cancelAnimationFrame`, `performance.now`, and a
    `MV::JS.pump(now_ms)` that fires due timers + animation-frame callbacks and
    drains promise microtasks. Passive `navigator`/`location`/`localStorage`.
  - ✅ NW.js `require('fs'|'path')` (local-file saves), `MV::JS.eval_file`, and
    `MV#boot`/`MV#main_loop` wired to evaluate `MV::CORE_SCRIPTS` and pump the
    host (dormant behind `runtime_available?` until M4 rendering).
  - Remaining: `document`/`Image` (canvas-related, land with rendering in M4),
    then flip `runtime_available?` on so the boot actually reaches
    `Scene_Title`.
- 🚧 **M4 — Rendering.** The Canvas2D → `Bitmap` bridge behind PIXI's Canvas
  renderer, so the title screen and map actually draw through `mruby-rgss`.
  - ✅ `document`/`HTMLCanvasElement`/`CanvasRenderingContext2D` backed by native
    RGBA buffers (`mvcanvas.cxx`): `fillRect`/`clearRect`/`drawImage`/
    `getImageData`/`globalAlpha`/`fillStyle`, WebGL absent so PIXI uses canvas.
    Unit-tested by pixel readback.
  - ✅ PNG `Image` loading (via stb, reusing mruby-rgss's
    `STB_IMAGE_IMPLEMENTATION`): `new Image()` decodes into a native canvas and
    is a `drawImage` source, with async `onload`/`onerror`. Game-relative asset
    paths are rooted at the game dir (`mv_resolve_path` / `MV::JS.base_dir=`).
  - Remaining: `putImageData`/typed-array `ImageData`, then present the main
    canvas each frame by copying it into a `Sprite`'s `RGSS::Bitmap`, and flip
    `MV.runtime_available?` so a real game boots to `Scene_Title`.
- 🚧 **M5 — Play.** Input (`Input`/`TouchInput`), save/load (the NW.js
  `require('fs')` shim) and audio (Web Audio → `RGSS::Audio`); a walkable MV game
  in the SDL window and the sixel/iTerm2 terminals.
- 🚧 **M6 — MZ.** A WebGL-subset backend on LVGL so PIXI v5 / RPG Maker MZ runs
  on the same foundation (`js/rmmz_*.js`).
